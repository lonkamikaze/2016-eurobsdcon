TL;DR
-----

I'm a Karlsruhe based hacker, working in research and development at the
Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. I'm a unicyclist, FreeBSD hacker,
metal head with a fondness for 8-bit µCs.

Long Version
------------

Between 2003 and 2006 I was a member of the TU Darmstadt's iCTF
(international capture the flag) contest team. In the Wizards of DoS I was
responsible for pattern matching (i.e. regex-fu), some scripting
languages (PHP *shudder*), SQL injections, automated exploit deployment,
flag collection and delivery. In 2006 I went to Karlsruhe shifting my focus
from hacking to studies.

In 2009 I started working on a framework for object oriented shell scripts
at the GPN8 (GulaschProgrammierNacht8) in Karlsruhe. This framework became
the foundation of a binary package manager for FreeBSD and was presented
at the EuroBSDCon 2010.

During my master studies I picked up the habit of building race cars,
with our FSAE team High Speed Karlsruhe. There I was the head of electronics
development for 2 years, resulting in 3 race cars.
During my tenure I dabbled in circuit board design and programming
8051 style µCs. 10k+ lines of our library code are available under
the beer-ware license.

Currently I work for the Institute of Materials and Processes at the
Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, where among other things
I write machining simulators in C++.

I also do weird stuff with AWK and shell scripts.
