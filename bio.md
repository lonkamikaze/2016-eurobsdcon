TL;DR
-----

I'm a Karlsruhe based hacker, working in research and development at the
Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. I'm a unicyclist, FreeBSD hacker,
metal head with a fondness for 8-bit µCs.

Long Version
------------

Between 2003 and 2006 I was a member of the TU Darmstadt's iCTF
(international capture the flag) contest team (the Wizards of DoS),
responsible for pattern matching (i.e. regex-fu), some light weight scripting
languages (PHP *shudder*), SQL injections and automated exploit deployment,
flag collection and delivery. In 2006 I went to Karlsruhe shifting my focus
from hacking to studies.

In 2009 I started working on a framework for object oriented shell scripts
at the GPN8 (GulaschProgrammierNacht8) in Karlsruhe. I used that to build a
binary package manager for FreeBSD and went to the EuroBSDCon 2010 with a
talk and a paper about it.

During my master studies I picked up the habit of building race cars,
with our FSAE team High Speed Karlsruhe, where I was the lead of electronics
development for 2 years and 3 race cars. Dabbling into circuit board design
and programming 8051 style µCs. 10k+ lines of our library code are available
under the beer-ware license.

Now, surrounded by mechanical engineers, I work for the Institute of Materials
and Processes of the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, where among
other things I write simulations in C++.

I also do weird stuff with AWK and shell scripts.
